# RentalCarsTechTest

An application to prove technical ability for a RentalCars.com interview

The application uses Jax-RS, RESTeasy and GSON to take the information from a .json file and display it in a readable format to the user. 
The application requires an Apache Tomcat v9.0 server to run using either the .war file or importing the project into eclipse and running 
it through eclipse.

The repository is a copy of my eclipse working directory and an included .war that can be immediately hosted on an Apache Tomcat v9.0 server
